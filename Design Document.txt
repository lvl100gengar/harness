File Transfer Harness
=====================
The application will allow users to configure file transfers at specified
intervals using HTTP(S) or SFTP. I am taking inspiration from load testing 
tools like k6. The harness enables testing of complex applications that process 
files and place them on destination servers. Transfer status is queried from a 
pair MySQL databases sitting at the ingress and egress points of the application.


Design Guidelines
=================
1. The application should work on current Linux OS, particularly RHEL 9, but
APIs which are platform-independent should be preferred.

2. The application should have a powerful and well-designed CLI. Include flags 
for verbosity. Ensure standard outputs are readable and structured since the 
terminal UX/UI is very important. CLI flags take precedence over config file.
No interactive mode required.

3. Include good logs that can help debug the application or network connectivity 
issues.

4. This application is intended to be long-running, so error handling should be
robust. Some errors, such as failing to connect to a server, are possible outcomes 
for the load test and should not cause the test to stop. At higher data rates, 
these types of failures need to be included as part of the statistics provided at 
the conclusion of the test run.

5. Use Python 3 to implement this project. Use best practices and Pythonic design
patterns. Determine best package references to implement the features below.


Features
========
1. While CLI flags can be used, the application should be fully configurable 
in a config file (YAML or something easily user-editable). Ensure this is 
user friendly and not tedious (e.g. handle whitespace). A well-documented sample
config should be provided to enable user to get started quickly.

2. The application should provide a way for users to configure HTTP(S) jobs.
An HTTP(S) job has a configuration method (e.g., POST), URL, SSL key/cert path (optional), a
path to a directory containing files to send, a way to specify rate to send
(include both sending including waiting for response and sending on time even
if the server has not responded yet). Also allow users to configure HTTP headers,
including the ability to generate UUIDs and include filename for each request.
Rates are specified using files per period (e.g., files/hour).

3. The application should provide a way for users to configure SFTP jobs.
An SFTP job is always a PUT. An SFTP job should have options for SSH key path
(optional) or password, a path to a directory containing files to send, a way to specify 
rate to send (include both sending including waiting for response and sending 
on time even if the server has not responded yet). Rates are specified using files 
per period (e.g., files/hour).

4. The application should be capable of executing several jobs concurrently. The 
idea is to simulate loads on the system where multiple data sources are uploading
simultaneously. Use thread/async APIs and ensure application remains responsive.

5. In addition to the mode described above which load tests the system, include a 
mode that queries 2 MySQL databases to get tracking information about files that have 
been sent in a given timespan. The 2 MySQL database connections and credentials are user 
configurable, but the database schema that should be expected is described below.
Include options for polling rate. The application should not modify the DB and any
errors with the SQL query are fatal.

Database schema:
 - UUID: a UUID unique to each transaction that will be used to correlate the 2 DBs
 - filename: string, name of file sent
 - startTime: a timestamp when the server started proccessing the file
 - endTime: a timestamp when the server completed proccessing the file
 - status: an enum of possible result codes (SUCCESS, FAILED, TIMEOUT)

The application should attempt to match entries from each DB based on UUID. The total 
transfer time is determed by (egress endTime - ingress startTime). The status from 
both DBs should be included in the output, but the egress status determined pass/fail.

The output of this process is a report in HTML format saved to a user-specified path.
The page should display the table of transfers and statistics about the entire test run.
The page is going to be provided to enterprise stakeholders so it should look professional
and use CSS as necessary. Key statistics we are interested in are pass rate, min/max/avg
transit times, etc.

Include a seperate list of database rows ff there are any which do not form a pair based 
on UUID. A row with each UUID should exist on boths DBs, otherwise an exceptional error 
has occured.
